I'm gonna tell you a story; A story of how two fated persons 
can have their fates entagled through a game played with the Soul of Cinder(Ghost).

All every person has to do is cross the valley of the Ghost by putting their soul in a mortal shell but there's always more 
to the picture than one can paint, right? The person crossing the valley of the Ghost has to avoid the ghost with whatever 
trick they have up their sleeves. And they would be able to do that if theirs was the only soul in the mortal shell. 
SURPRISE!
The mortal shell has the soul of your fellow possibly compatible partner. The person and their possibly compatible partner 
has to control the mortal shell to cross the valley of Ghost while collecting the pieces of their heart that has been 
splattered all over the valley of Ghost. If you do without the Soul of Cinder touching you, the reward 
is unfathomable and you have your MATCH!
